I only finished a simple one using `random` module, but there are two questions:

1. the `random` module only provides a "pseudo random" generator, what does that mean? is it ok to use it in this kind of scenario? 
2. what characters are generally used for coupons or activation codes? I used unicode 0x21 to 0x7E.
